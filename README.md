# git-issue

`git-issue` is a CLI tool for managing project issues locally.

## Getting Started

### Installation

#### Homebrew
To install `git-issue` using [homebrew](https://brew.sh), run the following:
```
brew tap uname-n/brew
brew install uname-n/brew/git-issue
```

#### Cline
Add [`git-issue`](/.clinerules/git-issue) to the `.clinerules` folder of your project.

#### Usage
The best way to use `git-issue` is to have **Cline** design in `plan` mode. 
When the plan is sufficient, switch **Cline** to act mode with the instruction: 
*`Using 'git-issue' create a sequential series of issue and sub-issues that once complete will have fully implemented the design.`*
With issues now created, in a new conversation, instruct **Cline** to review the issues, and complete the next task.
